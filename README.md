# Animal Sanctuary Project

## Project Overview

This application models an animal sanctuary as a learning exercise for my SkillDistillery cohort #46.  The user is prompted with a menu providing available actions to display a list of current animals, add an animal by name and type (when space is available), or accompany the animal care taker in feeding the animals their appropriate type and amount of food for the day.

## Technologies/concepts Used

- Java
- Polymorphism
- Inheritance 
- Get / Set
- Switch conditionals


## Lessons Learned
- Using scanner for user input only to an array element with a null value.
- Using loops to iterate through each element and conditionally calling methods.
- Using @Override to access methods in subclasses.
